"run_Analysis.R" is the R script that:
*Merges the test and training data sets
*Extracts only the mean and standard deviation measurements
*Applies descriptive activity names to each activity ID
*Appropriately labels the data with descriptive variable names
*Creates a tidy independent data set that averages data for each activity and each subject

"tidy_data_final.txt" refers to the final tidy data set created by the above script, and satisfies the descriptions above.

"CodeBook.md" is the project codebook that provides the variable names/descriptions as well as the activity names and IDs associated with them.
